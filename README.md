# WaveEffectInput

The Input Wave Effect project is a simple web application that showcases an engaging UI effect on input labels. When an input field gains focus, a wave-like animation is triggered, providing a visually appealing experience. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is centered around a static login form.

## Features

- **Input Wave Animation**: The labels of the input fields produce a wave-like animation when the respective input gains focus.
- **Clean UI**: The project features a simple and aesthetically pleasing design.
- **Static Login Form**: While the login form is present, it does not authenticate users and serves as a visual representation of the input effect.

## How It Works

The project operates with the following principles:

1. **HTML Structure**: The login form and input elements are defined in the HTML file.
2. **CSS Styling**: Styling is applied to create the desired visual effect and layout.
3. **JavaScript Interactivity**: Event listeners are utilized to detect input focus and trigger the wave animation.
